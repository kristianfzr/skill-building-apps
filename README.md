# Skill Building Apps

Welcome to the **Skill Building Apps** project! This monorepo is dedicated to hosting various applications built to learn and improve skills in modern web development technologies, such as JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS), React, and any related infrastructure if needed.

The goal of this project is to create a series of apps over time, each focusing on different concepts or techniques within the development ecosystem. This will serve as a personal portfolio of experiments and learning exercises. If certain apps evolve into more complex projects, they may eventually be extracted into separate repositories.
